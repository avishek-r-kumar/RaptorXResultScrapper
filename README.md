# RaptorX Scrapper 

## Description
A simple shell script for scraping RaptorX results programmatically, rather
than downloading them one-by-one.

## Usage
After submitting a bash job, RaptorX will assign a serial number sequentially
to each individual job and increment it by one. Therefore, if you know the
beginning and end serial number, you can download every job in the batch.
